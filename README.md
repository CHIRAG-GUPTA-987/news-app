This is a news application where you can see the top headlines of every field whether it is general, business, entertainment, technology, sports and many more. In this application, I have used API to fetch the latest news where I can easily set the country, category, page, pageSize and so on. There are two windows in this application, in one of the window I have used infinite scroll and in other one, I have used the old view of websites i.e, rendering only a few templates on a page. The most important part of this application is that it uses React JS which enables to load the big chunk in the first visit. Besides this, the news get loaded in some time, to give a better user experience, I have also added REACT-TOP-LOADING-BAR to this application.

To run this application in your local environment, you have to set up your own environment variables for API keys.
